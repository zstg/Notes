#+title: AD project ideas

* Core idea
- Comparison of photo vs phone-AI vs drone vs drone-AI (and/or) drone-text (i.e "What can be better?")
- https://typefly.github.io/
- Use 1 particular photo type (say of the moon) - and moon image datasets
- Analyze what could make the image better and report it.
  - Try to see which filter you can apply to make it better.
  - Note that minimal criteria simplify our work.

* Working
- Take instructions from prompt
- Use LLM to parse query. Also use web searches if necessary (_"/determine coordinates of the moon/"_ and such)
- Turn said query into an _action_ (how do we do this? is there a drone prog lang or such?)
- Perform the action (i.e _"/navigate to ~<x,y>~ and rotate <angle>/"_) and take photo
- Store photo in db (Firebase? Sqlite?)
- Access data from db using a mobile phone (or even the very (computer) we use to feed the input query)

* Inspiration
- https://www.designinfo.in/p/dji-mini3-combo-kit/?gQT=1 (Really good, 4K HDR cam, really pricey)
- https://www.amazon.in/whizfly-Cinematic-transmission-obstacle-Batteries/dp/B0DPHQW2MT/ (yet another 4K cam option, just for an idea)
- https://www.amazon.in/Wingsstar-3xSmart-Battery-Tri-Charger-Brushless-Motor/dp/B0DFWFCGBZ/ (same thing)
