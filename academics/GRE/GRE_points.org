- analytical writing: backup with claims/data/facts, do not use extreme language → prefer stats over anecdotes
- inference type questions → answer very broadly, do not overthink - eliminate extreme answers (will, should bad - may good)



* 28/9
** Arg questions
- claim/conclusion (ending in thus, therefore, so, hence, clearly, for this reason etc) rest on assumptions, based on/backed up by evidence (since, due to, bcos of, if,when etc)
  - _why_ test: Ask "Why?" - if it has an answer, it becomes the evidence. (You don't ask "why" to evidence - evidence is taken to be fact).
    claim +<->+ → evidence
- evidence
